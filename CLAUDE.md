## What This App Does

tripcoord is an AI-powered travel planning app. Users describe a trip (destination, dates, group, budget, priorities) and Claude generates a complete day-by-day itinerary with activity tracks, food spots, photo spots, and practical notes. The app also handles group collaboration (invite members, vote on activities, split expenses), packing lists, prep checklists, and a "Discover" feed of curated experiences.

---

## Repository & Deploy Workflow

**Repo:** `https://github.com/bhickle/tripcoord.git` (renamed from `TripHive` — GitHub redirects the old URL)  
**Branch:** `master` (auto-deploys to Vercel on every push)  
**Vercel project ID:** `prj_CXOmPJ4ffTCbxR4lurg3jho7pEsW`  
**Team ID:** `team_aXNtbEj1uZq70pRXyemRnhx5`

### Dev Environment
Working directly on the Windows-native filesystem (`C:\Users\abby0\Documents\Claude\TripHive`) via Claude Code. (Local folder kept as `TripHive` — it's wired into the Claude project path; renaming it gains nothing and breaks local config.) Default shell is **PowerShell**; Bash is also available via the Bash tool. Git operations run directly against the local repo — no temp clone needed.

### ⚠️ Stale Git Lock Files (OneDrive issue)
OneDrive sync occasionally leaves stale `.git/index.lock`, `.git/HEAD.lock`, or `.git/index2.lock` files when a git process is interrupted. Symptom: `fatal: Unable to create '.../.git/index.lock': File exists`.

**Fix:** verify no git process is actually running, then delete the stale locks:
```powershell
Remove-Item .git/index.lock, .git/HEAD.lock, .git/index2.lock -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
Or via Bash: `rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock .git/index2.lock`

### TypeScript Check
Always run before committing (working directory is already the repo root):
```
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Key Data Flows

### Trip Generation (SSE Streaming)
1. User completes Trip Builder (`trip/new/page.tsx`) → Step 8 → "Build My Trip"
2. A skeleton trip row is created via `POST /api/trips/save` with `mode: 'skeleton'` (empty `itinerary_data`)
3. User is redirected to `/trip/[id]/itinerary?mode=generating`
4. Itinerary page detects `?mode=generating`, clears localStorage, starts SSE stream via `GET /api/generate-itinerary`
5. SSE streams `day` events → client merges into live view via `syncAiDays()`
6. On complete, saves to Supabase via `PATCH /api/trips/[id]`

### Multi-City Generation
- `segments = [{cityName, dayStart, dayCount}]` — each city is a separate `streamSegment()` call
- City header in the day tabs uses `aiMeta.destinations + daysPerDestination` to map day → city

### Itinerary Data Model
```ts
ItineraryDay {
  day: number;           // 1-based
  date: string;          // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  city?: string;         // Per-day city (for weather, Maps, etc.)
  theme: string;
  tracks: { shared: Activity[]; track_a: Activity[]; track_b: Activity[] };
  trackALabel?: string; trackBLabel?: string;
  transportLegs?: TransportLeg[];
  meetupTime?: string; meetupLocation?: string;
  photoSpots?: PhotoSpot[];
  foodieTips?: FoodieTip[];
  destinationTip?: string;
  dinnerMeetupLocation?: string | null;
}
```

### Persistence Order
`syncAiDays()` → `localStorage` → `PATCH /api/trips/[id]` (fire-and-forget). Supabase is source of truth on reload; localStorage is fallback.

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Key Feature Limits |
|------|--------------------|
| `free` | 25 AI credits/mo (= 1 build), 4 travelers, 7-day max trip |
| `trip_pass` | 50 credits per pass (1 build + 1 regen + 5 small tweaks), 6 base travelers (extras purchasable), 7-day max |
| `explorer` | 100 credits/mo (~4 builds), 8 travelers, 10-day max, split tracks + co-organizer |
| `nomad` | 250 credits/mo (~10 builds), 15 travelers, 14-day max, all features |

Gates live in `useEntitlements` hook → checked against `profile.subscription_tier` from Supabase.  
`UpgradeModal` + `LockBadge` components handle the UI gating.

---

## Supabase

- **Project ref:** `pqizuvmtertpxhhxyemj`
- **URL:** `https://pqizuvmtertpxhhxyemj.supabase.co`
- Admin client bypasses RLS — use for server-side operations that need to see all rows
- Browser client respects RLS — use in API routes that should scope to the authenticated user
- **After any schema migration:** run `generate_typescript_types` MCP tool and write `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` in the same commit. Missing this breaks Vercel builds.

Key tables: `profiles`, `trips`, `itineraries`, `trip_members`, `trip_invites`, `trip_photos`, `group_messages`, `group_votes`, `vote_options`, `vote_responses`, `expenses`, `packing_items`, `souvenir_items`, `prep_tasks`, `wishlist_items`, `discover_destinations`, `featured_itineraries`, `seasonal_collections`, `waitlist`

## Environment Variables (Vercel)

All set in Vercel → tripcoord → Settings → Environment Variables.  
Claude cannot set these — Brandon must add them manually.

| Variable | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ Set | Main AI key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ Set | |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ Set | |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ✅ Set | Admin client |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | ✅ Set (test) | Swap for live before launch |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ Set (test) | Swap for live before launch |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | ✅ Set (test) | Swap for live before launch |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | ✅ Set | Invite emails |
| `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` | ✅ Set | Currently Gmail; change to `noreply@tripcoord.ai` at launch |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | ✅ Set | SMS invites (trial — needs upgrade for real users) |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | ✅ Set | |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | ✅ Set | +18445310179 |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | ✅ Set | Server-side Places API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | ✅ Set | Client-side Maps embed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | ✅ Set | https://www.tripcoord.ai |
| `PREVIEW_SECRET` | ⚠️ Optional (pre-launch) | Coming-soon bypass — `?preview=<value>` sets a 90-day cookie. **Middleware falls back to the literal `tc2026` when this env var is unset** (re-introduced 2026-05-13 to unblock pre-launch testers). Anyone who reads the bundled middleware JS can see the fallback, so it's a speedbump not real access control. **Before public launch:** set this to a strong value in Vercel AND remove the `?? 'tc2026'` fallback in `src/middleware.ts` line 11. Do BOTH — env var alone is not enough while the fallback is in source. |
| `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | ❌ Missing | Dynamic trip card photos (#78) |
| `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` | ❌ Missing | Real events data (#69) |
| `VIATOR_AFFILIATE_ID` | ❌ Missing | Affiliate booking links (#70) |
| `GETYOURGUIDE_AFFILIATE_ID` | ❌ Missing | Affiliate booking links (#70) |

## Open Development Tasks

These are the active items to build/fix, in rough priority order. Note: this list goes stale fast. Always cross-check against `git log` before assuming a task is unfinished — many "open" items here are knocked out within a session and not removed promptly.

### 🔴 Must-Fix Before Any More Testing
- _All previously listed items shipped. Add new launch-blockers here as they surface._
- ~~Server-side AI credit enforcement~~ — **Shipped 2026-05-08, extended 2026-05-16, refactored 2026-05-29.** Shared helpers `checkAiCredits` / `incrementAiCreditsUsed` in `lib/supabase/aiCredits.ts` (two-phase: gate before, charge after success — failed AI calls don't burn credits). Atomic increment via Postgres RPC since 2026-05-29 (`increment_user_ai_credits` / `increment_trip_pass_credits`) — parallel calls no longer clobber the read-baseline-then-write. **Trip Pass credit pooling**: when an AI action is fired with `tripId` AND that trip has an active Trip Pass, the charge routes to `trip_passes.ai_credits_used` instead of the user's personal counter. Trip-scoped AI endpoints (build, regen, add-day, suggest, transport-parse, parse-itinerary, discover, hotels, enrich) pass `tripId`; user-scoped Nomad endpoints (packing, phrasebook, receipt scan, layover) don't. Narrow TODO: a user whose own tier is `trip_pass` calling a user-scoped action without `tripId` is exempt. Currently only happens for Nomad-feature actions (which require Nomad tier anyway, so trip_pass users never reach them). **Build-level claim (2026-05-29):** chunked builds now charge ONCE per build via the `trips.build_credits_charged_at` atomic-claim — 25 credits per build regardless of chunks/cities. 1 free build = 1 actual trip, not "first 3 days of a trip" (see [Build credit claim semantics](#build-credit-claim-semantics) under Code Conventions). Multi-city is now properly gated to paid tiers (client `LockBadge` + server 403 `MULTI_CITY_LOCKED`).

### 🟠 Feature Work (Active)
- [ ] **Build durability Tier 2 (Inngest)** — Tier 1 shipped 2026-05-09 (server-owned abort + per-day persistence + resume detection). Tier 2 moves orchestration to an Inngest worker so builds complete even when the browser is fully closed. Blocked on Brandon's prep checklist (Inngest account + `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` / `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` in Vercel). See `memory/project_tier2_prep.md`.
- [ ] **Enable Google OAuth** (`#183`) — Google sign-in buttons exist but OAuth is not configured. Steps: Google Cloud Console → create OAuth Client ID → redirect URI: `https://pqizuvmtertpxhhxyemj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` → Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google → enable + paste keys.
- ~~Yay/Nay dead-space layout decision~~ — **Shipped 2026-05-25, commit `a28d0f5`.** Replaced the fixed 2-column grid with a CSS masonry flow so Group Votes, Activity Pulse, Wishlist, and Nay Watch auto-balance across two columns. No more dead space. Empty Group Votes state now shows an inviting card with starter prompts.
- [ ] **Monetization — affiliate go-live + repricing (post-launch)** — full plan in `MONETIZATION.md`. Phase 0 shipped (provider-agnostic affiliate layer in `src/lib/affiliate.ts`; gated "Book this" on activity cards + "Find this hotel" in Where to Stay — all dark until an env var is set). Remaining:
  - [ ] Once the domain is live, apply to affiliate programs: Travelpayouts (~24h auto-approve; also the path to GetYourGuide), Stay22 (~instant, hotels), Viator (direct, ~a few days, no traffic minimum).
  - [ ] Before enabling, confirm each partner's exact deep-link param format against their dashboard (Viator `pid/mcid`, Stay22 `allez`, Booking `aid`) — flagged in `src/lib/affiliate.ts`.
  - [ ] Turn it on by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIATOR_PARTNER_ID` / `_GETYOURGUIDE_PARTNER_ID` / `_STAY22_AID` / `_BOOKING_AID` in Vercel, then eyeball the live placement of the gated links (built without seeing them rendered).
  - [ ] **Pricing decision (launch-time, not strictly post-launch):** reprice subscriptions per Model A — collapse Explorer+Nomad into one Pro (~$39/yr), drop Trip Pass to ~$19, make group collab + expense-split free; update `src/lib/stripe-prices.ts` + `TIER_LIMITS`. Then converge toward free + booking commissions (Model B) as commission revenue proves out.
- ~~Invite-token system Phase 2 (privacy gate)~~ — **Shipped 2026-05-08, commit `8e575cb`.**
- ~~Trip Story real-data implementation~~ — **Shipped 2026-05-08.**
- ~~Per-priority difficulty UI~~ — **Closed 2026-05-08, won't build.**
- ~~Click expense line item to view/edit details~~ — **Shipped 2026-05-09.** Inline expand on expense rows reveals editable line items (description + amount, add/remove rows, optimistic save via PATCH). See `src/app/trip/[id]/group/page.tsx`.

### 🟡 Polish & UX
- [ ] **Reference-link fetch reliability** (shipped 2026-05-25, commit `58fdefe`) — "Plan this trip" on an On My Radar item now fetches the user's saved links via `/api/fetch-reference` (Reddit `.json`, else HTML→text; SSRF-guarded, bot UA, best-effort, no AI/credit cost) and feeds the extracted text to the generator as a "reference material" prompt slot. **Limitation:** it's a plain server-side fetch + tag-strip, so it gets little/nothing from sites that bot-block, login-wall, or render content in JS. Known problem sites: **TripAdvisor** (Cloudflare/anti-bot — and it's literally suggested in the paste box, so this will be common), **Reddit** (unauth bot 403s), **Instagram / TikTok / X / Facebook / Pinterest / Yelp** (login wall + JS), **Booking / Expedia / Airbnb** (anti-bot), **YouTube** (description only, no transcript), **Google Maps/Docs links** (JS app, no static text). Generally fine: most travel blogs, Medium/Substack, news articles, Wikipedia. Failure is graceful — `referenceContent` stays empty, the build proceeds on destination + priorities, and the Trip Builder's "pulled ideas" chip just never flips to "ready." **Fallback if it matters:** a render/proxy scraping service (e.g. a headless-render API) for the JS/anti-bot sites, official APIs where they exist (Reddit OAuth, YouTube transcript), and/or a Readability-style extractor + a small Haiku summarization pass on whatever HTML is retrieved.
- [ ] **Unsplash integration** (`#78`) — dynamic destination photos on trip cards. Code scaffold is ready; just needs `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` env var + wiring in `src/app/trips/page.tsx` and `dashboard/page.tsx`.
- [ ] **Ticketmaster events** (`#69`) — real event data on Discover/What's Out There. Needs `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`.
- [ ] **Viator/GetYourGuide affiliate links** (`#70`) — "Book This" links on activity cards in the itinerary. Scaffold at `scripts/enrich-affiliate-links.ts`. Needs affiliate registration + API keys (blocked until site is live for affiliate approval).
- [ ] **Prompt-cache optimization (low priority)** — `cacheableGuidance` can fall below Anthropic's 2K-token threshold for users with few priorities, in which case caching silently doesn't happen. Not a regression — the current architecture is correct, just sub-optimal at the low end. Bigger fix: move stable user-prompt content (budgetTierText, groupTypeText, walkingRuleText, etc.) into the cacheable region so multi-city chunks share more cache. Audit notes from 2026-05-08.
- [ ] **Deferred from the 2026-05-25 full-site QA** (full context in `SITE_QA_AUDIT.md`) — three low-priority items consciously left after the audit:
  - [ ] **Multi-city Trip Builder step-2 back-nav gate** — building a 2+ city trip, allocating nights, then clicking Back to "Where To" can leave **Next** stuck behind a "nights exceed your trip length" message (it compares against the default length that hasn't updated yet). Rare; worth fixing if reproducible. `src/app/trip/new/Client.tsx` (step-2 Next-disabled logic).
  - [ ] **Dashboard stale-session 401 redirect is dead code** — `/api/trips` returns `200 {trips:[]}` for an unauthenticated request, so the dashboard's "bounce to login on 401" never fires (an expired session shows an empty dashboard instead). Proper fix is a `/api/trips` contract change touching other callers, so left alone. `src/app/dashboard/Client.tsx:95`.
  - [ ] **Activity Pulse vote-count lag** — under simultaneous multi-user voting the on-screen count can briefly lag the `activity_votes` truth; self-corrects on reload, no data loss. `src/app/trip/[id]/itinerary/Client.tsx` (handleVote count merge).
- [ ] **Verify featured-fork date-less trip flow (live site)** — the `b42a18b` P1 fix (Add Day crash + "Invalid Date" header on date-less forks) could not be runtime-verified locally (no `.env.local`/Supabase keys, no browser automation, and the fork is a prod DB write). Confirm on tripcoord.ai while logged in: Discover → open a Seasonal Collection (or a matched Trending card) → **Use as starting point** → **Skip — I'll pick dates later** → the itinerary renders, day headers read **"Day N"** (not "Invalid Date"), and **+ Add → Day** works without freezing.
- [ ] **Verify saved-layover flow (live site)** — Layover Planner saved plans (`a92a627` + suggestions persistence) couldn't be runtime-verified locally (auth + DB write). Confirm on tripcoord.ai: set airport + time → Find → **+ Add to layover** items (and a hotel) → sidebar fills, reorder/remove work → **Save this layover** → leave the page and return → the switcher shows it and loading it restores the basket **and** the generated suggestions. Also confirm the Find button isn't stuck on return.
- [ ] **Verify build-credit refactor (live site)** — from the 2026-05-29 QA pass. Free-tier 7-day single-city build should complete end-to-end and charge **25 credits total** (not 75 per the old per-chunk math). Then click Regenerate on the same trip → charges another 25 (`profiles.ai_credits_used` increments by 25 each time; check via Supabase dashboard). As a free user, the "Add another destination" multi-city button should show a lock icon; if you DevTools-bypass the click handler, the API should 403 with `MULTI_CITY_LOCKED`.
- [ ] **Verify Stripe cancel-at-period-end (live site, requires Stripe test mode)** — also from 2026-05-29. From the Billing Portal click Cancel on a paid subscription → confirm `profiles.subscription_cancel_at` is set to the period end (Supabase dashboard). Reactivate before the period ends → row clears back to NULL. At period end, Stripe fires `subscription.deleted` → tier flips to `free` and `subscription_cancel_at` clears again.
- [ ] **Verify vote unique constraint (live site)** — invite a second member with the same display name as an existing member; both should be able to vote on the same poll without one silently failing (old `UNIQUE (vote_id, voter_name)` would have collided).
- [ ] **Storage cruft cleanup (low priority)** — photo-upload audit 2026-05-25: the `trip-photos` bucket has 7 orphan objects (all Apr 17–May 9, pre-fix era) with no matching `trip_photos` row, and the `avatars` bucket accumulates superseded avatars (timestamped paths, no delete-on-replace). Both are harmless storage cost, not correctness — the current upload path cleans up the storage object on a failed DB insert, so no NEW orphans accrue. Optional housekeeping script if storage cost ever matters.
- [ ] **Deferred feature ideas (rescued from the retired `QA_ACTION_LIST.md`, 2026-05-25)** — not bugs, just unbuilt:
  - [ ] **Frequent Flyers / travel-buddy list** — a saved list of recurring travel companions, so you don't re-enter the same people every trip. Surfaces in invite/member flows.
  - [ ] **Map the booked hotel** — when a hotel is marked "I Booked This," plot it on the trip map/route alongside activities.
  - [ ] **"Days Out There" playful counter** — make the dashboard stat card show something playful (hours/min/sec ticking) instead of a flat day count.
- [ ] **AI-behavioral retests (code fixes shipped 2026-05-25; confirm on a fresh live build)** — re-verify on real generations: (a) long itineraries cutting off ~12:30 PM / sparse days, (b) long trips repeating restaurants, (c) day-highlight text wrapping vertically in Nightlife/Shopping/Photo-tips, (d) day-count label disagreeing with dates (7-day card showing "6d").

### 🟢 Go-Live Prerequisites (Brandon-owned)
- [ ] **Lowercase `tripcoord` rebrand — remaining steps.** Product copy, email templates/bodies, comments, affiliate tracking params, and forward-looking docs were rebranded + pushed 2026-05-25 (commit `910e3e1`, `tsc` clean — pure 1:1 token swap, no identifiers touched). Old variants (Wayfare / TripHive / TripCoord) are gone from app code. Brand is **strictly lowercase everywhere**. What's left is dashboard/infra work:
  - [ ] **GitHub:** rename repo `TripHive` → `tripcoord` (Settings). Old URL auto-redirects, so nothing breaks immediately. _Then ask Claude to run `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/bhickle/tripcoord.git`._
  - [ ] **Vercel:** rename project `TripHive` → `tripcoord` (Settings → General; project ID `prj_…` unchanged, deploys unaffected, git link follows the GitHub rename).
  - [ ] **Vercel env:** set `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@tripcoord.ai` (also tracked in the env-vars table above).
  - [ ] **Supabase Auth → Email Templates:** paste the updated copy from `email-templates/confirm-signup.html` + `email-templates/reset-password.html` (live emails are dashboard-configured; the files are just source).
  - [ ] **Supabase (optional, cosmetic):** rename the project display name (ref `pqizuvmtertpxhhxyemj` is immutable — nothing connects by name).
  - [ ] **SendGrid:** update the verified sender's display name if it still reads "TripCoord" (code now sends as `tripcoord`).
  - [ ] **Claude can do on request:** (a) read-only Supabase content scan (discover/featured/seasonal/notifications rows) for any stored "TripCoord" strings; (b) sweep `/mockups/*` (still say `TRIPCOORD`) and the stale `wayfare` path note in `CLAUDE_CODE_FIXLIST.md:296`.
  - Note: the **local folder stays `TripHive`** on purpose — it's wired into the Claude project path; renaming gains nothing and breaks local config.
- [ ] Re-enable email confirmation in Supabase (currently OFF for testing ease)
- [ ] Complete SendGrid domain authentication so emails land in inbox, not spam
- [ ] Add `/auth/update-password` to Supabase redirect allowlist
- [ ] Upgrade Twilio from trial to Pay As You Go + complete A2P 10DLC registration
- [ ] Swap Stripe test keys for live keys + recreate products in live mode + update `src/lib/stripe-prices.ts`
- [ ] Reset AI credits: `UPDATE profiles SET ai_credits_used = 0;` (run on the day of launch, after final testing)
- [ ] Reset Brandon's credits during testing: `UPDATE profiles SET ai_credits_used = 0 WHERE email = 'brandon.hickle@gmail.com';`
- [ ] Set `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel env vars (any random string) — the daily preferences-fallback cron at `/api/cron/preferences-fallback` returns 500 every day at 09:00 UTC until set. Steps in the route's docstring.
- [ ] **Drop three brand icon assets in `/public/`** — none of these exist yet, so:
  - `og-image.png` (1200×630) — what shows when someone shares a tripcoord.ai link on iMessage/Slack/Twitter/Facebook. Without it, the preview thumbnail is blank. Referenced in layout metadata since commit `4653e36`.
  - `favicon.ico` (16×16 + 32×32 multi-size .ico file) — the small icon in browser tabs and bookmarks. Without it, browsers show a default generic icon.
  - `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180) — the icon iOS uses when someone adds tripcoord to their home screen. Without it, iOS uses a screenshot of the page, which looks ugly.
  - All three can be generated from the tripcoord wordmark/icon — a free service like [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net) takes one source image and outputs the full set. Drop the files in `/public/` and they just work; no code changes needed.

## Code Conventions & Gotchas

### Declaration Order in itinerary/page.tsx
This file is 4000+ lines. `useCallback` and `useMemo` must come **after** all the `useState` and `useRef` declarations they reference. TypeScript in strict Next.js builds treats forward references inside closures as errors. Always grep `const \[myVar` vs `const myFunc` to verify ordering before committing.

### TypeScript Property Access
Always check `src/lib/types.ts` before accessing a property on a typed object. Common traps:
- `aiMeta.preferences?.priorities` (nested under `preferences`, NOT `aiMeta.priorities`)
- `aiMeta.destination` (singular, NOT `.destinations[0]` — use `tripRow?.destinations?.[0]` for multi-city)

### Design Mockup Rule
**Before making any font/color/layout change, show an HTML mockup to Brandon first.** Do not touch source files for visual design changes without prior approval.

### Supabase Types After Migrations
After any `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` migration:
1. Run `generate_typescript_types` MCP tool
2. Write output to `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
3. Include this in the same commit as the migration
Skipping this step causes Vercel build failures.

### Pre-Commit Checklist
Before every `git push`:
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors required
2. Check declaration order (hooks before their deps)
3. Check type shapes match `types.ts` and `database.types.ts`
4. Check cross-file response shapes (API route → caller)

### Mock Data Scope
`src/data/mock.ts` is **only** for the demo/preview experience (unauthenticated users). All authenticated user flows must use real Supabase data. Never fall back to mock data for logged-in users.

### Brand color discipline
The product runs on a tight palette — don't introduce new accent families ad-hoc.

- **Primary action color: sky-800 / sky-900.** Used for `.btn-primary`, every Settings save button, every itinerary action, every Group hub CTA. The `.btn-primary` global was amber until 2026-05-29; flipping it to sky was a one-line cascade across auth.
- **Amber-500 / amber-600**: reserved for **Trip Pass marketing** (Trip Pass tier card, the "Most popular" badge on landing+pricing) AND the landing-page hero CTA. Anywhere else, amber reads as "Trip Pass / paid hero." Do NOT use amber for generic primary actions.
- **Emerald-600**: the "Best value" badge (Explorer). Reserved for that single role.
- **Track A = sky-500, Track B = amber-500**. Was violet/rose pre-2026-05-29; both colors are now reused for other purposes ("AI Pick" badge = violet pill; error states = rose) so don't reintroduce violet/rose for tier or track identification.
- **Neutrals: text-zinc-900 for headings, text-zinc-500-700 for body, text-slate-500-700 for form labels.** Mix them carefully — pages that mix zinc + slate without intent feel inconsistent. The Day-Of page used to live in a parallel slate palette; reconciling it to zinc fixed the "different product" feel.
- **Borders + chrome:** `border-zinc-100` for content cards (white-on-parchment cards), `border-slate-200` or `border-slate-300` for interactive form controls. Mixing slate and zinc on borders is OK if they're in different contexts.

If you find yourself reaching for purple/indigo/rose/pink/teal as a "fresh accent," stop. The palette was deliberately narrowed in the 2026-05-29 design sweep — re-introducing colors widens the maintenance surface and dilutes the brand.

### Empty state pattern
Use `<EmptyState>` from `src/components/EmptyState.tsx` for any list/grid/tab that needs to render a "nothing to show here" state. Don't hand-code a new icon-title-cta cluster.

```tsx
<EmptyState
  icon={MessageCircle}
  title="No messages yet"
  description="Say hi to the crew below."
  compact      // optional — less vertical padding for in-tab use
  cta={{ label: 'Browse Discover', href: '/discover' }}       // OR
  action={{ label: '+ Add first expense', onClick: handler }} // OR neither
/>
```

The component renders: white `rounded-2xl border-zinc-100` card, centered icon in a `zinc-100` chip, semibold `zinc-700` title, `zinc-500` description, optional `bg-sky-800 rounded-full` CTA. Hand-coding the same shape per surface was how we ended up with 6 different empty-state patterns across the app pre-2026-05-29. Three are now using the component (chat / expenses / packing); other surfaces can migrate incrementally.

The Group Votes "starter prompts" empty state (with clickable question chips) is a deliberate richer variant — leave it alone. `<EmptyState>` is for the simple icon-title-description-CTA case.

### Build credit claim semantics
Chunked builds (long single-city, multi-city) call `/api/generate-itinerary` once per 3-day chunk, but billing is per-build, not per-chunk. The race-safe primitive is an atomic claim on `trips.build_credits_charged_at`:

```
UPDATE trips
SET build_credits_charged_at = now()
WHERE id = $tripId AND build_credits_charged_at IS NULL
RETURNING id;
```

The chunk whose UPDATE returns a row wins the claim and pays via `checkAiCredits` + `incrementAiCreditsUsed`. Every subsequent chunk's UPDATE returns 0 rows → that chunk is `source: 'exempt'` and skips both gate and increment. Regenerate (`?fresh=1`) sends `freshRebuild: true` on its first chunk ONLY (one-shot `sentFreshRebuild` flag in the build effect); server clears the claim before re-claiming. Two failure cases revert the claim so the user can retry: `checkAiCredits` 402-denied and `dayIndex === 0` at stream end. Trip Pass pooling is unaffected — pooling logic lives inside `checkAiCredits` which still runs once for the claim winner. Don't move credit charging out of this pattern without preserving the "1 build = 1 charge" guarantee; the prior per-chunk model 402'd free users mid-build.

### Supabase Browser Client Singleton
**ALWAYS** import the singleton from `@/lib/supabase/client`, never call `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` directly:
```ts
import { createClient as createSupabaseBrowserClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client';
const supabase = createSupabaseBrowserClient();
```
Multiple instances fight over the same auth Web Lock and silently drop the auth session, which makes calls run as anonymous and silently fail RLS. This was the root cause of the photo-upload-vanishes-on-refresh bug (commit after `9191974`).

### Verify-before-show (AI emit gate)
Every AI route that emits a day or activity to the user runs through a 2-tier location-validation gate BEFORE the data reaches the client. The shared helper is `src/lib/places/verifyDayLocations.ts`:

```ts
import { validateAndCorrectDay } from '@/lib/places/verifyDayLocations';
const result = await validateAndCorrectDay(dayObj, {
  anthropic: client,
  modelId: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  systemPrompt: SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  placesApiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY ?? '',
  maxRetries: 2,
  sendStatus: (msg) => send({ type: 'status', message: msg }),
});
if (!result.ok) { /* hard fail — return 500 / SSE error, don't charge */ }
return result.day;
```

**Tier 1** (free): string-check every activity's `address` against `day.city` (normalized — strip diacritics, lowercase, expand St./Mt.). **Tier 2** (~$0.03/venue): Places API lookup for venues that passed Tier 1, check the resolved `formattedAddress` contains `day.city`. On failure: re-prompt the AI for the single failing day/activity with explicit correction guidance + retry up to 2x. On hard fail: emit error + don't charge credits.

Coverage: `/api/generate-itinerary` (all 3 SSE emit sites), `/api/trips/[id]/add-day`, `/api/suggest-activity`. The smaller-grain `addressContainsCity` + `lookupPlacesAddress` are exported for the single-activity path. Brandon's 2026-05-30 directive: "I want it to verify before becoming an itinerary." Don't add a NEW AI-emit route without wiring it through this gate.

## Recently Shipped (May 29 night → May 30 morning — QA pass + landing reposition + verify-before-show)

Two-day marathon. Started with a 5-agent QA pass on the full site, became a strategic landing reposition (group-OS pitch, demote AI itinerary), became cost-cutting AI model routing, became a brutal-honesty product audit, ended with a real correctness bug fix that grew into a multi-route verify-before-show architecture. **17 commits.**

**QA pass — 5 themed fix groups (commits `503be26` → `aa96791`)**
- Group A — Day-Of + Print palette reconciliation: ~30 slate→zinc swaps on dayof; `rounded-xl` → `rounded-2xl` on hero + tile cards; End-of-day button `slate-900 rounded-xl` → `sky-800 rounded-full`; Print page amber → zinc on Tonight's Stay + prep notes (was overusing amber for non-Trip-Pass copy).
- Group B — Brand color violations: Bus/Coach `indigo-*` → `sky-700`; HIGHLIGHT_CATEGORY_META nightlife `fuchsia-*` → `amber-*`; Date Night `pink-*` → `rose-*`; `/trips` share filter `amber-500` → `sky-800`.
- Group C — Button shape normalization: prep Generate AI List + Pack tabs `rounded-xl` → `rounded-full`; group pending member row `rounded-xl` → `rounded-2xl`; community/[id] like+fork+activity-like `rounded-lg` → `rounded-full`.
- Group D — Hand-rolled empty states → shared `<EmptyState>`: dashboard "Tumbleweeds", itinerary "No itinerary yet", Discover community-empty (3 → 6 adopters).
- Group E — API + prompt hardening: EDITORIAL BACKBONE MAY → MUST swap on dietary/accessibility clash; CommunityTripCard day-preview responsive grid (`grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`).

**Landing + pricing visual unification (commits `a70084c` → `4785b67`)**
- New shared `<MarketingNav>` component at `src/components/MarketingNav.tsx`; mounted on `/` AND `/pricing` (was a stripped Back+logo shell). Anchor links use `/#all-in-one` and `/#how` so they navigate-and-scroll from /pricing AND hash-scroll from /.
- Hero copy rewritten: "✦ The group trip's planning OS — solo welcome too" + h1 "Plan it together. Pull it off as a group." Toolkit grid 8 emojis → Lucide icons in sky-50 chips with sky-800 strokes. Pillar 1-4 reordered: Group → Split Tracks → Day-Of → AI (was AI first). Cruise mode tile DROPPED (overselling what shipped); Group voting tile added. "split tracks" prose unbolded. "Everything inside" nav link → "All In One Place" with parity in the section eyebrow.

**Anonymous-app-access gating (commit `d0868ab`)**
- Brandon's directive: "no ways to get into the app without registering for the free version." Audit found two unguarded surfaces: `/trip/[id]/*` (the layout) and `/onboarding`. Both now redirect unauth users to login/signup with `?redirect=` preservation. Marketing/Discover stays public — funnel content, not app.

**Onboarding terminal fork screen (commit `95e294c`)**
- After signup + profile + persona, the wizard used to auto-route to /trip/new. Now lands on a new step 2 fork screen asking "What do you want to do first?" with three CTA cards: Build a trip (sky-700 primary) → /trip/new?firsttrip=true · Browse Discover → /discover · Look around → /dashboard. Profile saves on step 1→2 transition so the fork CTAs are pure navigation.

**AI model routing (commit `cbfe2e1`)** — cost-cutting per Brandon's brutal-honesty session
- `parse-receipt` Opus 4.7 → Haiku 4.5 (vision OCR; ~15x cheaper)
- `add-day` Opus 4.7 → Sonnet 4.6 (single day = one /generate-itinerary chunk; Opus was overkill)
- `generate-phrases` Sonnet 4.6 → Haiku 4.5 (translation, Haiku's sweet spot)
- `parse-transport` Sonnet 4.6 → Haiku 4.5 (structured extract)
- Untouched: generate-itinerary, suggest-activity, generate-layover, parse-itinerary (quality-critical).

**QA-pass P0 + quick wins (commits `388e11f`, `3c1f59c`)**
- Trip layout auth flash: was render-then-redirect (unauth users briefly saw shell); now renders centered "Loading…" until auth resolves.
- Auth cross-link `?redirect=` preservation: "Already have an account? Log in" + "Don't have an account? Sign up" + "Already confirmed? Log in" links now carry the redirect param forward (was dropping it, breaking the onboarding cold-start chain).
- Discover guest header `border-slate-200` → `border-zinc-200`; pricing billing toggle inactive contrast `zinc-500` → `zinc-600`; onboarding step-1 hint copy tweak; documented `?firsttrip=true` param semantics.

**The Versailles bug + verify-before-show (commits `49266ae`, `e1f1233`, `08b5db1`, `4e71b68`) — the biggest architectural shift**

Brandon caught a real correctness failure: a Paris trip's Versailles excursion-day listed La Jacobine ("59-61 Rue Saint-André des Arts, 75006 Paris") as the lunch venue, 17 km from the Palace of Versailles, with a fabricated "5 min walk, 0.2 mi" transport leg. Four stacked gaps:

1. `day.city` was set to the BASE city for day-trips (per the prompt rule), so the model lost the "we're in Versailles all day" anchor.
2. No prompt rule said "every activity's address must be in the day's city."
3. Transport-leg distance/duration was unchecked AI free text.
4. `verifyVenues` only checks open/closed status, not location.

**Layer 1 — prompt fix (49266ae):** Three edits to `generate-itinerary/route.ts`. `day.city` rule rewritten ("set to the EXCURSION city, not the base city"). DAY-TRIP EXCURSION RULE extended with three sub-rules: (a) set city correctly, (b) every venue MUST be in excursion city with explicit category-fallback if uncertain, (c) return leg unchanged. New Rule 23 — ADDRESS-CITY CONSISTENCY anti-hallucination guard — applies universally with "STOP and pick a different venue" instruction.

**Layer 2 — verify-before-show (e1f1233 + 08b5db1 + 4e71b68):** Brandon vetoed the UI warning badge approach ("verify before becoming an itinerary"). New helper `src/lib/places/verifyDayLocations.ts` exports `validateAndCorrectDay` + the smaller-grain `addressContainsCity` + `lookupPlacesAddress`. Pipeline: every emitted day/activity passes through Tier 1 (string check `address ⊃ day.city` with diacritic strip + St./Mt. expansion) + Tier 2 (Places API lookup, concurrency-capped at 6). On failure, the failing day/activity is re-prompted with explicit correction guidance, retried up to 2x. Status events stream to the client ("Fixing location issues on day 3…"). Hard fail emits a 500/SSE error with a clear human-readable message naming the venues; credits NOT charged on hard fail. Wrapped routes: `/api/generate-itinerary` (all 3 SSE emit sites — main, salvage, continuation), `/api/trips/[id]/add-day`, `/api/suggest-activity`. Group hub's "Suggest another" also fixed to pass `day.city` instead of `tripDestination`.

**Side product/strategy work (no code)**
- Strategic brutal-honesty session: positioning ("group OS" not "all-in-one"), surface-area cut suggestion (defer Cruise/Memories/Travel Map marketing), pricing simplification analysis (partner-discussion outline in `PRICING_TIER_COLLAPSE_OUTLINE.md`).
- Pricing tier collapse outline saved to repo root as `PRICING_TIER_COLLAPSE_OUTLINE.md` (decision: keep all four tiers for now per Brandon; document captures the case for $30→$35 Trip Pass, adds Travel Agent tier as a future B2B offering with separate landing page, confirms annual discounts already at 20%).

**New code artifacts**
- `src/components/MarketingNav.tsx` — shared landing+pricing header
- `src/lib/places/verifyDayLocations.ts` — verify-before-show helpers
- `src/lib/itinerary-preview.ts` — extracts day preview shape for community/founder endpoints (from earlier in the marathon)
- `PRICING_TIER_COLLAPSE_OUTLINE.md` — partner-discussion outline

**Verify next on live**
- Anonymous user → /trip/some-id/itinerary should briefly show "Loading…" then bounce to /auth/login?redirect=… (no shell flash).
- Onboarding cold start: register → profile → style → fork screen with three cards.
- Landing reads as group-OS (group voting tile, "Plan it together. Pull it off as a group.").
- Pricing page has the full landing header.
- AI quality spot-checks on the Haiku routes: receipt scan, phrasebook, transport parse, add-day.
- The big one: re-trigger a Paris+Versailles trip. Versailles day's lunch should be a real Versailles-area venue (palace café, La Flottille, Au Bonheur de Stéphanie, etc.) — NEVER a Paris venue. Watch for status events ("Fixing location issues on day N…") in the live build banner if the AI tried something wrong-city.
