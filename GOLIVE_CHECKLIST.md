## 🚀 Deploy pipeline (CURRENT BLOCKER — added 2026-06-05)

### 🟧 Vercel stopped deploying pushes — restore the Git trigger
**Why:** As of 2026-06-05, pushes to `master` stop producing Vercel deployments. The last deployment that actually built is **`8353e91`** (the Inngest foundation). Two later commits — **`f781285`** (background-build finalize function + the `/api/cron/inngest-sync` auto-resync) and the empty re-trigger **`df67c53`** — are on GitHub's `master` but Vercel created **no deployment record at all** for either. Vercel → Settings → Git still **shows "connected."** "No deployment record created" points to a broken **GitHub→Vercel webhook**, not a build-capacity problem — so the paid "On-Demand Concurrent Builds" feature is **not** the fix and isn't needed.

**Not urgent:** the **live site is fine** on `8353e91`, and the only undeployed code is **dormant** (the finalize function + resync cron don't fire until something sends their events). No user impact. This is cleanup, not a fire.

**Steps (do #1 to get current code live, then #2 to fix it for good):**
1. **Deploy Hook (free, any plan — unblocks immediately):** Vercel → trip-hive → **Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks** → create one (any name, branch `master`) → copy the URL. Open it in a browser (or paste it to Claude to fire) — it builds the latest `master` (`df67c53`), bypassing the broken webhook.
2. **Reconnect Git (fixes the root cause):** Vercel → **Settings → Git** → **Disconnect** the repo → **Connect** it back to `bhickle/TripHive`. This re-registers the webhook so normal pushes deploy again. Sanity check: GitHub → repo **Settings → Webhooks** → the `vercel.com` hook → **Recent Deliveries** should show fresh green deliveries.
3. **Confirm:** push a trivial commit (or have Claude do it) and verify a new production deployment builds within ~1 min.
4. **After it deploys:** the `itinerary-finalize` Inngest function needs to register — run `curl -X PUT https://www.tripcoord.ai/api/inngest` once (or just wait for the 6-hourly `/api/cron/inngest-sync`, which does the same thing automatically — but that cron only exists once `f781285` is deployed).

> ⚠️ Note from Claude: this was likely triggered by me pushing 10+ deploys in rapid succession during the tier-change work. Going forward I'll batch changes into far fewer deploys.

## 🔑 External services / API keys

### 🟥 Unsplash — create app, set demo key, then apply for Production
**Why:** Code is wired (attribution chip, download tracking, UTM-tagged links, server-side hotlinking) but `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` is **not set** in Vercel — the Unsplash photos feature is dormant. Demo tier caps at 50 req/hr; you'll want Production (5,000/hr) before launch traffic. Approval takes a few days to a week.

**Steps:**
1. Create an Unsplash developer app at https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications
2. Copy the Access Key, add `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to Vercel env (Production + Preview)
3. Redeploy — confirm photos render on trip cards
4. Once live and traffic-verified, click **"Apply for Production"** in the Unsplash dashboard
5. **Timing:** apply 1–2 weeks before any marketing push.

### 🟥 Stripe — swap test keys for live
**Why:** Currently using test-mode keys, so no real charges go through.

**Steps:**
1. In Stripe Dashboard, switch to live mode
2. Recreate products (Trip Pass $36 one-time, Travel Pro $14.99/mo + $149/yr) in live mode — note the new price IDs. NOTE: test-mode price IDs are still PLACEHOLDERS in `stripe-prices.ts` (`price_REPLACE_ME_*`) — create the test-mode prices first for pre-launch testing, then the live ones here.
3. Update `src/lib/stripe-prices.ts` with the live price IDs (replace both the placeholders and the `legacy` block once no legacy subs remain)
4. Update Vercel env vars:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → live publishable key
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` → live secret key
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → new webhook secret (create a new live-mode webhook endpoint pointed at the Vercel `/api/webhooks/stripe` URL)
5. Redeploy
6. Test one purchase end-to-end with a real card before announcing

### 🟥 Twilio — leave trial mode
**Why:** Trial accounts can only SMS pre-verified numbers. Real users will be silently blocked.

**Steps:**
1. Add a payment method to upgrade from trial → Pay-As-You-Go
2. Complete A2P 10DLC registration (US carriers require this for SMS — Twilio walks you through it; takes a few days)
3. Confirm the existing `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` (+18445310179) is approved on the new campaign

### 🟥 SendGrid — finish domain authentication + verify sender
**Why:** Without DKIM/SPF set up for `tripcoord.ai`, invite emails land in spam. The default fallback sender (`hello@tripcoord.ai`) is hardcoded in 2 routes — verify it as a sender before relying on the fallback.

**Steps:**
1. SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication → Authenticate Your Domain
2. Add the CNAME records SendGrid generates to your DNS provider (Vercel DNS or wherever the domain lives)
3. Verify within SendGrid
4. Update `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` env var to `noreply@tripcoord.ai` (currently a Gmail address)
5. Verify `hello@tripcoord.ai` as a Single Sender too (used as a hard-coded fallback in `/api/invite/email` and `/api/auth/send-reset-email`)
6. Send a test invite to a fresh inbox to confirm it lands in Inbox, not Spam/Promotions

### 🟥 Supabase — upload branded auth email templates
**Why:** Default Supabase auth emails (signup confirm, password reset) look generic/spammy. Branded HTML lives in `email-templates/` at the project root.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. Paste `email-templates/confirm-signup.html` into the **Confirm signup** template (subject: "Confirm your tripcoord account")
3. Paste `email-templates/reset-password.html` into the **Reset Password** template (subject: "Reset your tripcoord password")
4. Save both, send a test trigger from `/auth/signup` and the password reset flow

### 🟥 Sentry — create project and set DSN env vars (optional but recommended)
**Why:** Without it, you launch blind. `@sentry/nextjs` is already installed and config files are wired — they no-op cleanly without the DSN, so the app works either way. Adding the DSN flips on error monitoring with stack traces.

**Steps:**
1. Create a free account + project at https://sentry.io
2. Copy the DSN
3. Vercel → tripcoord → Settings → Environment Variables → add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (client-side errors) — same DSN value
   - `SENTRY_DSN` (server-side errors) — same DSN value
4. Redeploy
5. (Later) for source maps in Sentry: add `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` + wrap `next.config.js` with `withSentryConfig`. Not blocking — readable error frames work without it.

### 🟥 Inngest — Tier 2 build-durability prep (post-launch ready)
**Why:** Tier 1 build durability shipped 2026-05-09 (server-owned abort + per-day persist + resume detection). Tier 2 moves orchestration to an Inngest worker so builds complete even when the browser is fully closed. Not strictly launch-blocking, but recommended within the first 1-2 weeks of real traffic.

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://inngest.com, create a tripcoord environment
2. Vercel env vars: add `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` + `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` (Production + Preview)
3. Verify `itineraries` is in the Supabase `supabase_realtime` publication (Database → Replication)
4. Tell Claude when you're ready and the worker migration ships next

See `memory/project_tier2_prep.md` for the full prep notes + design rationale.

## 🔐 Auth / user setup

### 🟥 Supabase — re-enable email confirmation
**Why:** Currently OFF for testing ease. Real users should confirm their email.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → toggle "Confirm email" ON
2. Verify the confirmation email template + redirect URL look correct

### 🟥 Supabase — add `/auth/update-password` to redirect allowlist
**Why:** The password reset flow redirects users to `/auth/update-password` after they click the email link; if it's not in the allowlist, Supabase rejects the redirect.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs
2. Add `https://www.tripcoord.ai/auth/update-password`
3. (Optional) add `http://localhost:3000/auth/update-password` for local dev

### 🟥 Google OAuth — enable Google sign-in (issue #183)
**Why:** Google sign-in buttons exist on /auth/login and /auth/signup but OAuth isn't configured, so the buttons currently no-op.

**Steps:**
1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth Client ID (Web application)
2. Authorized redirect URI: `https://pqizuvmtertpxhhxyemj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Copy the Client ID + Secret
4. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google → toggle on, paste the keys
5. Test the flow on production after deploy

---

## 🗄️ Data hygiene + ops

### 🟥 Reset AI credit counters
**Why:** Testing during development pollutes the `ai_credits_used` counter. Real users should start at zero.

**Steps:** Run this against production Supabase:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET ai_credits_used = 0;
```
Do this **the day of launch**, after final testing, before announcing.

### 🟥 Set `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel
**Why:** The daily preferences-fallback cron at `/api/cron/preferences-fallback` returns 500 every day at 09:00 UTC until this env var is set.

**Steps:**
1. Generate a random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`)
2. Vercel → tripcoord → Settings → Environment Variables → add `CRON_SECRET` with the random value
3. Redeploy

### 🟥 Drop `/public/og-image.png` (1200×630) for social previews
**Why:** Layout metadata already references `/og-image.png` as the OpenGraph + Twitter card image. Until the file exists, link previews on iMessage / Slack / X / Facebook show a blank thumbnail. The metadata is wired (commit `4653e36`); just need the asset.

**Steps:**
1. Export a 1200×630 PNG (tripcoord wordmark on parchment background, or hero composition)
2. Save as `/public/og-image.png` (case-sensitive — Vercel Linux is case-sensitive even though Windows isn't)
3. Verify after deploy: paste the homepage URL into Slack / iMessage and confirm the preview renders
4. Optionally validate with https://www.opengraph.xyz/url/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripcoord.ai

### 🟥 Pre-launch database backup
**Why:** Once real users start writing trips, photos, expenses — losing data is unrecoverable. Take a snapshot before you announce.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups
2. Trigger a manual backup, verify it appears in the list
3. (Already on Pro tier? Daily PITR is automatic — confirm it's enabled.)

### 🟥 Verify production env vars set
Quick audit before launch — one missing key silently degrades a feature:

| Variable | Required for | CLAUDE.md status |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI itinerary generation | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | All client/SSR auth | ✅ Set |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | API admin client (RLS bypass) | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Subscriptions + Trip Pass | 🟧 Test mode — see Stripe section above |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` | Invite + reset emails | 🟧 Gmail sender — see SendGrid above |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | SMS invites | 🟧 Trial mode — see Twilio above |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` | Places autocomplete + Maps | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Email/SMS link generation | ✅ Set (`https://www.tripcoord.ai`) |
| `PREVIEW_SECRET` | Coming-soon bypass | 🟥 Verify set — middleware refuses all preview attempts when missing |
| `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` | Trip card cover photos | 🟥 Missing |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Daily preferences fallback | 🟥 Missing |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` / `SENTRY_DSN` | Error monitoring | 🟥 Missing — recommended |
| `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` / `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` | Tier 2 build durability | 🟥 Missing — post-launch |
| `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` | Real events on What's Out There | 🟥 Missing — post-launch |

### 🟥 npm audit + dependency review
- `npm audit` — review high/critical findings; only patch if exploitable in our context
- Vercel deployment logs scrolling cleanly, no recurring 500s
- Supabase advisors clean (Database → Advisors)
- Confirm RLS is enabled on every table that holds user data

## 🔒 Security / hardening

> Added 2026-06-05. Context: the live site only exposes the **front-end** (minified client JS, HTML, copy, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars) — server code, AI prompts, and secret keys are never sent to the browser. The bigger exposure is the **source repo** and **misconfigured data access**, which is what this section covers.

### 🟥 Make the GitHub repo private — HIGHEST-VALUE ITEM
**Why:** `github.com/bhickle/TripHive` is **public** (confirmed 2026-06-05 — anonymous API request returns 200, `"visibility": "public"`). That means anyone can read the *entire* codebase — server logic, the AI generation prompts (the real IP), the schema, everything — with no hacking. This is the actual "someone steals the code" risk, far more than the live site.

**Steps:**
1. GitHub → repo **Settings** → scroll to **Danger Zone** → **Change repository visibility** → **Private**
2. Confirm Vercel deploys still fire (they will — the GitHub integration keeps working on private repos; no reconnect needed)
3. Push a trivial commit and verify a new production deployment builds

### 🟥 Scan git history for accidentally-committed secrets
**Why:** Secrets currently live in Vercel env vars (not the repo), which is correct — but a key may have been committed at some point in history and never removed. A public repo makes any such leak readable; even after going private, leaked keys should be rotated.

**Steps:**
1. Run a scanner against full history — `gitleaks detect --source . --redact` or `trufflehog git file://.` (or ask Claude to scan)
2. For any real hit: **rotate that key** at its provider (Anthropic/Stripe/Supabase/SendGrid/Twilio) — removing it from history is not enough once it's been public
3. Going forward, keep all secrets in Vercel env vars only; never commit `.env*`

### 🟥 Remove the `tc2026` coming-soon fallback + set a strong `PREVIEW_SECRET` (QA SEC-3)
**Why:** `src/middleware.ts` falls back to the literal `?? 'tc2026'` when `PREVIEW_SECRET` is unset. Anyone who reads the bundled middleware JS can see it, so it's a speedbump, not access control. Do **both** halves — env var alone isn't enough while the fallback is in source.

**Steps:**
1. Vercel → Environment Variables → set `PREVIEW_SECRET` to a strong random value (`openssl rand -hex 24`)
2. Edit `src/middleware.ts` (~line 15) — remove the `?? 'tc2026'` fallback so a missing secret fails closed
3. Redeploy; confirm `?preview=tc2026` no longer bypasses the gate and `?preview=<strong value>` does

### 🟥 Domain-restrict the public Google Maps key
**Why:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` is shipped in the client bundle (unavoidable for Maps). Without restrictions, anyone can lift it and run up your bill on their own site.

**Steps:**
1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → the public Maps key
2. **Application restrictions** → HTTP referrers → add `https://www.tripcoord.ai/*`, `https://tripcoord.ai/*` (+ a Vercel preview pattern if needed)
3. **API restrictions** → limit to only the APIs actually used (Maps JS, Places, Static Maps)
4. Keep the **server-side** `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` separate and unrestricted-by-referrer (it's called server-side); optionally restrict it by IP

### 🟥 Supabase RLS audit (the real guard on user data)
**Why:** The anon key is public by design, so **RLS policies are the only thing stopping a stranger from reading/writing other users' rows.** A missing or too-loose policy is the highest-impact data-leak risk at launch — bigger than any code exposure.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase → Database → **Advisors** → resolve every security advisory
2. For every table holding user data (`profiles`, `trips`, `itineraries`, `trip_members`, `expenses`, `group_messages`, `trip_photos`, `votes`, wishlist, etc.): confirm RLS is **enabled** and each policy scopes rows to the owning user / trip member — not `using (true)`
3. Spot-check with the anon key: confirm you cannot read another user's trip/profile rows
4. Confirm the **service-role** key is used **only** in server code (`lib/supabase/admin`), never shipped to the client (ask Claude to grep)

### 🟥 Confirm no secret is exposed client-side
**Why:** The one way server secrets leak into the browser is being prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or returned by an API response.

**Steps:**
1. Audit that only genuinely-public values use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (Supabase URL + anon key, Stripe publishable key, Maps key, app URL) — ask Claude to grep `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
2. Confirm no API route returns a secret in its JSON (Anthropic/Stripe/service-role keys)
3. Confirm security headers are sane (Vercel sets reasonable defaults; consider a strict `Content-Security-Policy` post-launch)

## 🧪 Pre-launch test pass

### 🟥 Smoke test — core flows on production with a fresh account

- [ ] Sign up → confirm email lands → click link → land on dashboard
- [ ] Build a trip via the wizard, full multi-city, generate itinerary all the way through
- [ ] Edit the trip (destination/dates), regenerate
- [ ] Add a day, add an activity, vote on activities
- [ ] Invite someone via email, they accept, they show in members
- [ ] Invite someone via SMS (different phone number than the trial whitelist)
- [ ] Group chat sends + receives, **emoji reactions sync in realtime across two browsers**
- [ ] Create a vote, members cast, organizer closes
- [ ] Add an expense, settle it, **edit line items inline**, scan a receipt
- [ ] **Custom split** — confirm the live "shares total $X of $Y" preview turns green when balanced
- [ ] Mark itinerary `is_public_template = true`, view at `/community/[id]` — **organizer name shows first-name only**
- [ ] Fork the public template from `/discover`, dates persist, "(Copy)" suffix appears on Home Base
- [ ] Like an itinerary, like an activity, both counts persist on refresh
- [ ] **Logged-out, click Like on a community card → bounced through login → returns to /discover, like applied**
- [ ] Add destination to wishlist, paste a TripAdvisor URL, see preview card render
- [ ] **Wishlist heart toggle on /discover and /wishlist** — toggle off, refresh, confirm gone; toggle on, refresh, confirm saved
- [ ] **On My Radar source icons** — Globe (has links) vs Pencil (manual) renders correctly per card
- [ ] Click a Seasonal Collection card on Discover, grid filters correctly (or shows quick-plan chips when catalog is missing)
- [ ] Generate AI packing list (Travel Pro), AI phrasebook (Travel Pro)
- [ ] Buy a Trip Pass with a real card (after Stripe live keys are in)
- [ ] Subscribe to Travel Pro with a real card
- [ ] Cancel the subscription via the customer portal
- [ ] Trigger the password reset flow end-to-end
- [ ] Sign out, sign back in, dashboard reloads correctly

### 🟥 Photo flows (likes/comments/upload)

- [ ] Upload a photo to a trip — Day + Location are mandatory, button gates until both selected
- [ ] Refresh, photo still there with correct day grouping
- [ ] Upload progress reaches 100% and resolves cleanly (no 88%-stuck regression)
- [ ] Open a photo modal — Like button works, count persists across refresh
- [ ] Post a comment, edit it (pencil icon on hover), confirm "(edited)" indicator appears
- [ ] Delete a comment via custom in-app modal (no native browser confirm)
- [ ] **Two-browser realtime test:** open same photo on two browsers, like + comment from one, confirm the other updates within seconds without refresh
- [ ] Photo filter "Mallory" vs "You" — when you ARE Mallory, both filters return identical photos
- [ ] Verify uploader names are real names (or email-local-parts), no literal "You" persisting

### 🟥 Build durability — Tier 1 fixes

- [ ] **Tab close mid-build:** start a 7+ day trip, close tab around day 4, reopen 30s later, confirm resume from day 5+ (not day 1)
- [ ] **Refresh mid-build:** same as above but with a refresh instead of close
- [ ] **Long generation (Dublin-class):** 9-10 day single-city trip with food + nightlife + shopping all selected. Watch Vercel logs:
  - Should see `[generate-itinerary] persistGenerationDays` lines per day
  - If `First pass stop_reason=…` fires with `partialDayBuffered=true`, confirm `recoverTruncatedArray salvaged N day(s)` follows
  - Final result should have all requested days, no truncation
- [ ] **Mobile sleep mid-build:** start a build on mobile, lock the screen during generation, unlock — page should resume

### 🟥 Default travel partner

- [ ] Set a default partner via Settings → Default travel partner (email lookup)
- [ ] Confirm validation: self-pair rejected, unknown email rejected
- [ ] Create a new trip — partner auto-appears as a member in Group on first load
- [ ] Past trips are NOT retroactively shared (new trips only, by design)

### 🟥 Group Pack realtime

- [ ] Two browsers on the same trip's Prep page → Pack This → Group tab
- [ ] Add an item from one, confirm it appears in the other within seconds
- [ ] Toggle "packed" from one, confirm the checkbox flips on the other
- [ ] Delete from one, confirm it disappears from the other

### 🟥 Regenerate flow

- [ ] On a trip with `?mode=generating` already complete, click Regenerate (organizer-only)
- [ ] If it errors, "Go back and try again" button returns you to the trip page (not Trip Builder)
- [ ] Successful regenerate — new days replace old, no stale Iceland data flashes

### 🟥 Mobile-specific

- [ ] Trip Builder works on iPhone Safari + Chrome Android
- [ ] Photo upload flow works on mobile (camera roll picker)
- [ ] Photo modal Like + Comment buttons are tappable (always-visible affordance on touch widths)

## 📋 Open feature work (not launch-blocking)

These are useful to track but won't block launch. Status: not blocking but valuable post-launch.

- 🟥 **Ticketmaster events** (`#69`) — needs `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` env var
- 🟥 **Viator/GetYourGuide affiliate links** (`#70`) — needs `VIATOR_AFFILIATE_ID` + `GETYOURGUIDE_AFFILIATE_ID` env vars; affiliate registration blocked until site is live for approval. Once approved, scaffold at `scripts/enrich-affiliate-links.ts` populates `affiliate_url` / `affiliate_label` on existing activities; new generations pick up the IDs from env automatically.
- 🟥 **Group wishlist + voting** — let friends collaborate on "where should we go?" (deferred from On My Radar discussion)
- 🟥 **Comparison view on wishlist** — pick 2-3 saved destinations, see cost/season/flight-time side-by-side
- 🟥 **Calendar/seasonal strip on wishlist** — show items on a year ribbon by best season
- 🟥 **Seasonal Collections SEO landing pages** at `/discover/seasons/[slug]` (option B from the seasonal-collections discussion; A+C shipped instead)
- 🟥 **Web Push notifications (Tier 3)** — VAPID keys + service worker. Recommended to ship alongside Tier 2 Inngest, not before.
- 🟥 **`<img>` → `<Image>` migration** — TripStoryModal (12 instances), discover/[slug] hero, memories. Perf + a11y win, needs visual review.
- 🟥 **External legal review** — privacy + terms have been content-updated to match what's actually shipped (community sharing, OG link fetches, Sentry, analytics). Still worth a real lawyer pass before launch given AI use, payment data, and user content licensing.
- 🟥 **Yay/Nay dead-space layout decision** — green-bordered empty area in the votes section's right column. Needs Brandon's design call.

---
